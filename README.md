# Implementation

## Frontend
- manually defined CSS classess (no external framework)
- HTML 5 syntax
- Javascript used to apply CSS transforms (rotation) and canvas selection
- Ajax call to implement save function
- Jinja templates and includes to organize web application layout

## Backend
- Flask to handle user sessions and load/save data
  - Base Table is generated by passing a python dictionary containing all the necessary informations (type of cell, borders,colors) to the javascript frontend
- Sqlite3 database to store user data and maps data
